This page connects to the [`Coingecko API`](https://www.coingecko.com/es/api/documentation) to obtain information about cryptocurrencies. The entire front-end is built with Next.js, and the charts are generated using the [`Chart.js`](https://www.chartjs.org/) library. The fonts used are provided by [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize it automatically.
